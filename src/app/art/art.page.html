      <p>Philip Mullen came to South Carolina in 1969 and is one of the most renowned artists
        in the state. His works have been hanging in the Koger Center for the Arts since 1990,
        filling the space with his pieces that examine light and air. Throughout his art
        displayed in the Koger Center, Mullen explores the juxtaposition of light and how light
        touches everything around it. He has been described as creating works with even distribution
        of thought-out technique and carefree fluidity. From the Whitney Museum to the San Francisco
        Museum of Art, Mullenâ€™s pieces have showcased his abilities all across America and the Koger
        Center is proud to house a permanent exhibit.</p>
